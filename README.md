# End-Hunger-WareHouse

Background:
One of the most prevalent problems faced by the globe now is world
hunger. A vast number of individuals succumb to hunger and starvation
every year, whatâ€™s even more devastating is the fact that a majority of
the these victim are children under the age of five. Their economic
struggles, available land, overcrowding, and many other disturbing
factors are claimed to be contributing factors to the rise in hunger. The
situation has constantly been deteriorating, which has been very
apparent in the recent years due to the epidemic.
According to the World Bank, the epidemic would force 71 million
people into poverty throughout the world. Also, 70 to 161 million people
are likely to have experienced with hunger.

Target:
End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition.

Idea:
Develop a multi-platform system/application that will show all the
donation stations around the world. Without any need for workers, the
system can run multiple stores/storage compounds/facilities to provide
an online storing/shipping service. Thus, through this application,
restaurants, factories, etc. can send food nearing its expiry date to these
facilities. These food/donations can then be distributed to those who
need them. Those who are in need can also go to these facilities to get
some food rations and supplies for survival. The user could also check
the amount of goods and materials or money in the station around the
world. All storage/delivery functions are done via autonomous
devices/sensors/robots. This system's structure must be faultless; that is,
the system is meant to be operated in outside situations, such as being
able to move smoothly and pass over small obstacles. The transportation
of donated goods will be more efficient and convenient with this
approach, and it will indirectly help the community in need.
